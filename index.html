                    <h2 class="title">About</h2>
                    <p id="about_text">Freightway is a virtual trucking company that has been built from the ground up by virtual trucking enthusiasts. This is a company that has been in the development process since January of 2022. We all have a strong passion for virtual trucking and many of us have been a part of the community for over five years or more. We have made it our overall goal to build this company as professional as possible while retaining the fun environment that should be in all online communities.
                    <br><br>To bring more realism to the community, we have custom-built a DriversHub with many great and exciting features. We have over seven divisions (Refrigerated, Flat Bed, Heavy Haul, etc) with more in the planning process with custom modifications coming with them. Divisions aren’t the only thing we will be offering as you have the choice to haul whatever you solely desire and when. Our requirements are designed to allow you freedom with the only exception being the tag that you must wear on TruckersMP and what colors to bring to official events.</p>
